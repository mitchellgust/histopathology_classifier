# Histopathology Classifier (Project 1)
Our project will involve developing a machine learning system that will classify histopathology images of cancerous cells.

Our dataset is based on an existing dataset, 'CRCHistoPhenotypes', and consists of 27x27 RGB images of cells from 99 unique.

**Dataset:**

`K. Sirinukunwattana, S. E. A. Raza, Y. Tsang, D. R. J. Snead, I. A. Cree and N. M. Rajpoot,”Locality Sensitive Deep Learning for Detection and Classification of Nuclei in Routine Colon Cancer Histology Images,” in IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, vol. 35, no. 5, pp. 1196-1206, May 2016, doi: 10.1109/TMI.2016.2525803.`

**Our project will perform two tasks using this dataset:**
- Classify whether a given cell image represents cancerous cells
- Classify the type of cell shown in a given cell image
